        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Gavin Cox, and this is my website. Here you can find out more about me, look at my resume, and see how to contact me.<br>
        I currently work for AT&T as a broadband technician and really enjoy the work I do.
        I am looking to advance my career in the telecommunications industry with my main focus being cellular technologies going forward.
        In my previous positions, I worked in consumer sales, helpdesk support, an IT admin, and of course now as a technician.
        I am enrolled at the University of Arkansas Grantham for a Bachelors Degree in Information Systems, with a focus on cybersecurity.
        I currently reside in Decatur, Arkansas, and I am very comfortable with any kind of commute or relocation needed.
        I consistently strive to continue learning with everything I do, so I am always working on a certification in my free time.
        If you have any questions whatsoever, please do not hesitate to <a href="src/pages/contact.html">Contact</a> me!</p>
